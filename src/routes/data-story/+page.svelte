				<h2>Intro</h2>
				Red and Slim found the two strange little animals the morning after they heard the thunder sounds.
				They knew that they could never show their new pets to their parents. There was a spatter of
				pebbles against the window and the youngster stirred in his sleep. Another, and he was awake.
				He sat up stiffly in bed. Seconds passed while he interpreted his strange surroundings. He wasn't
				in his own home, of course. This was out in the country. It was colder than it should be and
				there was green at the window. "Slim!"

				<h2>Section 1</h2>
				The call was a hoarse, urgent whisper, and the youngster bounded to the open window. Slim wasn't
				his real name, but the new friend he had met the day before had needed only one look at his slight
				figure to say, "You're Slim." He added, "I'm Red." Red wasn't his real name, either, but its
				appropriateness was obvious. They were friends instantly with the quick unquestioning friendship
				of young ones not yet quite in adolescence, before even the first stains of adulthood began to
				make their appearance.

				<h2>Section 2</h2>
				Slim cried, "Hi, Red!" and waved cheerfully, still blinking the sleep out of himself. Red kept
				to his croaking whisper, "Quiet! You want to wake somebody?" Slim noticed all at once that the
				sun scarcely topped the low hills in the east, that the shadows were long and soft, and that
				the grass was wet. Slim said, more softly, "What's the matter?"

				<h2>Section 3</h2>
				Red only waved for him to come out. Slim dressed quickly, gladly confining his morning wash to
				the momentary sprinkle of a little lukewarm water. He let the air dry the exposed portions of
				his body as he ran out, while bare skin grew wet against the dewy grass. Red said, "You've got
				to be quiet. If Mom wakes up or Dad or your Dad or even any of the hands then it'll be 'Come
				on in or you'll catch your death of cold.'"
